# Data_Anaylsis_5000YoutubeChannel
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing information about 5,000 YouTube channels. The purpose of this analysis is to extract insights about channel performance, growth patterns, grades , and viewer engagement trends. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and possibly predictive modeling to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.

**Description**

The dataset comprises metadata about 5,000 YouTube channels. Each channel is described by various attributes, including metrics like subscribers,video views count, video uploads count, grades, and engagement statistics.

**Project Structure**

The repository is structured as follows:

Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies.

**Analysis Workflow**

1. Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and check for missing or null values.

Handle missing values through imputation or removal as necessary.

Normalize or scale relevant numeric columns for easier analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions of key metrics, such as subscribers, views, and engagement rate.

Identify trends across categories (e.g., which categories have the highest engagement rates).

Plot relationships between features (e.g., subscribers vs. average views).

Explore outliers or channels with unusual growth patterns.


3. Feature Engineering:

Generate additional metrics, such as average views per subscriber.

Create grade(5,4,3,2,1).

Encode categorical variables where applicable.


4. Modeling (Optional):

Predict potential growth metrics using regression or classification techniques.

Use clustering to identify similar types of channels.


5. Results & Visualizations:

Save visualizations in the results/visualizations folder.
